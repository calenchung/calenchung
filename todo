- We have to make the team page look differently. Purnendu looks squished to the corner. Should we add photos for people?

Mobile:
- ATLAS Header, rest is white for content. Maybe add X or CLOSE at the bottom

- The fading is super nice â€“ but the single white tiles don't move and don't animate. To make it nice it should be different tiles that become white for each pages
- Show hand icon when rolling over buttons and logo
- Darken the background so the button always pops, it is sometimes hard to read
- There are all kinds of error messages in the console
- The content boxes don't seem to disappear: The link for the email is persistent even if not visible, and I can't select the mission statement


Mobile:
- Checkerboard background
- Type centered in squares
